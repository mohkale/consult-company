;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a command to interactively complete a company
;; completion candidate through completing-read using the consult API.
;; This works much like the builtin `completion-at-point' command except
;; it can accept candidates from `company-backends' making it consistent
;; with the completion candidates you would see in the company popup.
